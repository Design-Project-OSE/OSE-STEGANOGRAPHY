The project processes audio and image data and symmetrically encrypts the received text.  The user is given a key to open the encrypted text, and it is their responsibility to ensure the security of the key.
The encrypted text is hidden in the audio or image data using shorthand methods. The project can extract the hidden text from the image.

Please note that this is a warning. To uncover the information concealed in audio files, our project must hide it and require a key for access.
